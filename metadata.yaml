  # TODO: Support model resource.  The SavedModel format is actually a
  #       directory, so we would need to request it as a tarball or such
  #       and then unzip it and read all the files in manually, or possibly
  #       do something fancy with storage.

  #    Model to serve. This can also be provided via the 'model-path'
  #    config option, but the resource will be preferred over the option.
